    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1:</h4>

all one liquid<p/>
<hr>
<h4>Step 2:</h4>

<p>Grab your pan and fill it with about 10 drops of olive oil</p>
<hr>
<h4>Step 3:</h4>
<img src="img/s3.jpg" width="600px" height="800px">
<p>Use and fill the latel all the way and pour it on the pan. Tilt the pan so
   the mixture evenly spreads out on the pan. Keep the mixture on heat until
    it solidifies. When it does solidify, flip the crepe over and until the
     other side is cooked</p>

   <h4>Step 4:</h4>

   <p>Repeat step 3 until you have as many crepes as you can make.</p>
   <hr>
   <h2>Filling, Folding, and Decorating</h2>
   <h4>Step 4:</h4>
   <p>Once you have all of your crepes, you need to figure out what you're going
     to fill your crepe with. The filling can be almost anything. I'm using
      Pomergranite Jam and Nutella. You can either smear half way, or fully, this is full preference<p>

        <img src="img/s7.jpg" width="600px" height="800px">
        <hr>
        <h4>Step 5:</h4>
        <p>Roll the crepe up top to bottom, if you're only coving half the
           crepe, make sure the the half way point is parallel to the bottom of
            the crepe, as shown in the picture</p>

<hr>
            <h4>Step 6:</h4>
            <p>Volia! Here's your new crepe. Now let's get on to decorating it.
               Grab your now rolled up crepes and put them in a container,
                whether for immedient use or saving for later, it's nice to not
                have to get a plate. For my purposes, I cut my crepes in halves.
                Grab what ever toppings you want and put it on the crepes. I'm
               using chocolate syrup</p>

               <h3>Finished Notes</h3>
               <p>Once you have finished making, filling, and decorating your crepes,
                 you can enjoy a great meal/desert. I hope this recipe taught
                you how to make a crepe!
